## Hi, I'm Kevin - Security Analyst & Blue Team Builder

I’m an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional focused on Detection Engineering, Cloud Security, GRC, and Automation.
I learn by building real labs and solving real problems — everything in my GitHub is hands-on, documented, and built from scratch.

I’m currently developing a full Blue Team portfolio with real SecOps workflows across Microsoft Sentinel, Azure, Sysmon, OpenVAS, PowerShell, Python, Bash, and industry security frameworks.
